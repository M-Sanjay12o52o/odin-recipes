    <ul>
        <li>2 cups basmati rice</li>
        <li>500 grams chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1-inch piece of ginger, grated</li>
        <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons biryani masala or a blend of ground spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric, cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust according to your spice preference)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon saffron strands, soaked in 2 tablespoons of warm milk</li>
        <li>A handful of fresh mint leaves</li>
        <li>A handful of fresh coriander leaves</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons ghee or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Then, soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large pot or deep skillet, heat the ghee or vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and sauté until they turn golden brown and crispy. Remove half of the fried onions and set them aside for garnishing.</li>        
        <li>To the remaining onions in the pot, add minced garlic and grated ginger. Sauté for a minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken pieces to the pot and cook until they are browned on all sides.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chopped tomatoes, biryani masala, red chili powder, and salt. Cook for a few minutes until the tomatoes soften and release their juices.</li>
        <li>Add plain yogurt to the pot and mix well with the chicken and spices. Cook for another couple of minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain the soaked rice and add it to the pot, stirring gently to combine with the chicken and spices.</li>
        <li>Pour in the water and bring it to a boil. Once it starts boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes or until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed. Make sure not to overcook the rice.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is cooked, remove the pot from the heat. Drizzle the saffron-infused milk over the rice and sprinkle fresh mint leaves and coriander leaves on top. Cover the pot again and let it rest for 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li>Finally, fluff the rice gently with a fork and transfer the Chicken Biryani to a serving dish. Garnish with the reserved fried onions.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy the aromatic and flavorful Chicken Biryani!</li>
    </ol>
