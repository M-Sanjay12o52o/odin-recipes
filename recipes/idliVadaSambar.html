    <h2>Description: </h2>
    <p>Idli, vada, and sambar are iconic South Indian dishes that make for a delightful and satisfying meal. Idli is a steamed rice cake with a fluffy texture, while vada is a crispy fried lentil fritter. These two dishes complement each other perfectly, with idli providing a mild and comforting base, and vada adding a savory and crunchy element. Alongside them, sambar steals the show with its tangy and aromatic lentil stew, packed with vegetables and spices. The combination of soft idli, crispy vada, and flavorful sambar creates a mouthwatering medley of textures and flavors that is enjoyed not just for breakfast but throughout the day.</p>

    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
    <h3>Idli: </h3>
        <li>Wash and soak idli rice and urad dal separately for about 4-6 hours.</li>
        <li>Grind the urad dal and fenugreek seeds together to a smooth batter. Grind the rice separately to a slightly coarse texture.</li>
        <li>Mix the urad dal batter and rice batter together, adding salt. Allow the batter to ferment overnight or for 8-10 hours.</li>
        <li>Grease the idli molds and pour the batter into them. Steam the idlis for about 10-12 minutes until they are cooked and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Remove the idlis from the molds using a spoon or knife and serve hot.</li>

    <h3>Vada: </h3>
        <li>Wash and soak urad dal for 3-4 hours. Drain the water.</li>
        <li>Grind the soaked urad dal to a smooth batter, adding very little water if required.</li>
        <li>Add rice flour, chopped ginger, green chilies, coriander leaves, and salt to the batter. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep pan or kadai for frying.</li>
        <li>Wet your hands, take a small portion of the batter, and shape it into a small round disc with a hole in the center.</li>
        <li>Gently slide the vada into the hot oil and fry until golden brown and crispy on both sides.</li>
        <li>Remove the vadas from the oil, drain excess oil on a paper towel, and repeat the process with the remaining batter.</li>

    <h3>Sambar: </h3>
        <li>Cook toor dal in a pressure cooker with water until soft and mushy. Mash it well and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat oil and saut√© the chopped onions until translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the mixed vegetables and cook for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes, sambar powder, turmeric powder, and salt. Mix well and cook until the tomatoes are soft.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked and mashed toor dal to the pot along with tamarind pulp. Stir well and bring it to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat and simmer for about 15-20 minutes until the vegetables are tender and the flavors are well blended.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.</li>
